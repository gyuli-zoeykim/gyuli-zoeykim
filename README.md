### :wave: Hi there!

#### My name is Gyuli. I'm excited to start my journey as a developer!

The idea of creating interactive and visually appealing websites and applications that can be shared through out the world excited me. I enjoy the challenges of coding and not afraid to learn and implement new methods.

Main Skills on building responsive websites using a combination of React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Utilizing Figma to plan and design for user-friendly interfaces.
